Coordinator: Before we proceed to the injection, do you have any questions or concerns today?
Patient: Well, actually yes. I've been a bit worried about my blood sugar levels lately. My father has diabetes, and I've noticed I've been feeling a bit more thirsty than usual. Is that something I should be concerned about during this study?
Coordinator: That's important to mention. We're not specifically monitoring blood sugar in this protocol, but I'll make a note of your concern. You might want to discuss this with your primary care physician. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
Patient: Not really major symptoms, but I did feel unusually fatigued last week - not anything serious, just more tired than normal. It only lasted two days though and I'm fine now. I didn't think it was worth reporting as an adverse event.
Coordinator: I appreciate you mentioning that. Even if it seems minor, it's good to keep track. Now, about medications - are you still taking only the medications we discussed at screening?
Patient: Yes, but I wanted to ask - I have seasonal allergies coming up in spring. Can I take my regular antihistamine if needed? I usually take cetirizine. Will that interfere with the study drug?
Coordinator: Good question. Let me check the protocol... Antihistamines are generally permitted for minor conditions. But please contact us before taking anything new so we can verify it's allowed. Moving forward with the injection now.
