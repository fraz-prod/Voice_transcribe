        CLINICAL TRIAL SCREENING CALL - NURSE COORDINATOR & PATIENT
================================================================================

[Call begins]

Nurse Coordinator (Ninna): Hi, this is Ninna calling from the clinical research
center. Am I speaking with the patient enrolled for the HAE study screening?

Patient: Yes, hi Ninna. That's me.

Ninna: Great, thank you for taking the time today. I'm going to walk you through
a series of questions to determine your eligibility for this clinical trial.
Some are inclusion criteria — things we need a "yes" on — and some are exclusion
criteria — things we need a "no" on. Please answer as honestly as you can. Ready?

Patient: Sure, go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          INCLUSION CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- 1. Willingness to Consent/Assent ---

Ninna: To participate, you and, if you're under 18, your parent or legal
guardian, would need to be willing and able to read, understand, and sign a
consent form. Are you comfortable with that?

Patient: Yes, absolutely. I'm 24, so no guardian needed, and I'm happy to sign
the consent form.

Ninna: Perfect, thank you. That's a pass on consent.

--- 2. Age ---

Ninna: And just to confirm, you mentioned you're 24 years old — is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm 24.

Ninna: Great, that meets our age requirement. Moving on.

--- 3. HAE Type 1 or 2 Diagnosis ---

Ninna: Do you have a documented diagnosis of Hereditary Angioedema, specifically
Type 1 or Type 2?

Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with HAE Type 1 a few years ago. My doctor has
all the documentation.

Ninna: Wonderful. We'll confirm that with your medical records as well. Next
question.

--- 4. HAE Attack Frequency ---

Ninna: In the past few months, have you typically experienced at least 2
Hereditary Angioedema attacks, averaging at least one attack per month?

Patient: Unfortunately, yes. I've been getting about two to three attacks a
month recently. It's been pretty tough.

Ninna: I'm sorry to hear that. That does meet the frequency criteria for the
study, though. Hopefully this trial can help.

--- 5. Vaccine Restriction ---

Ninna: During the study, you would need to agree not to receive any vaccines
within 7 days before or after receiving the study medication. Is that something
you can commit to?

Patient: Yeah, I don't have any vaccinations coming up, and I can plan around
that. So yes, I can commit to that.

Ninna: Thank you. Good to know.

--- 6. Contraception (Female) ---

Ninna: This next one is for female participants. For female participants who can
become pregnant, you must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must agree to use
highly effective birth control during the study and for 9 months after your last
dose. Is this something you can do?

Patient: I'm male, so this one wouldn't apply to me.

Ninna: Correct, that's not applicable for you. We'll mark that accordingly.

--- 7. Contraception (Male) ---

Ninna: For male participants who can produce sperm and have a partner who can
become pregnant, you must agree to use highly effective birth control during the
study, unless you are unable to produce sperm or your partner is surgically
sterile. Is this something you can do?

Patient: Yes, my partner and I can use the required birth control. That's fine.

Ninna: Okay, perfect. Thank you.

--- 8. Sperm Donation Restriction ---

Ninna: You must also agree not to donate or store sperm for 9 months after your
last dose of study medication. Is this acceptable?

Patient: Yes, that's totally fine with me. No plans for that anyway.

Ninna: Great.

--- 9. Egg Donation/Fertility Treatment Restriction ---

Ninna: You must also agree not to donate or store eggs, or undergo fertility
treatments for 9 months after your last dose of study medication. Is this
acceptable?

Patient: That's not applicable to me since I'm male.

Ninna: Right, we'll note that as not applicable. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          EXCLUSION CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ninna: Now I'm going to ask a few questions where we need a "no" answer. These
are things that would prevent participation if present.

--- 10. Previous Navenibart Trial ---

Ninna: Have you ever participated in any other clinical study involving the
medication called Navenibart?

Patient: No, I haven't. This would be my first time hearing about that
medication actually.

Ninna: Good, that's what we need. Thank you.

--- 11. Recent Investigational Drug/Device ---

Ninna: Have you used any experimental drugs or medical devices as part of
another study within the last 90 days?

Patient: No, I haven't been part of any other studies recently.

Ninna: Perfect.
Ninna: Have you ever received gene editing therapy?
Patient: No
Ninna: Have you used Lanadelumab (Takhzyro) for HAE prevention within the last 90 days?
Patient: No
Ninna: Have you used Berotralstat (Orladeyo) for HAE prevention within the last 21 days?
Patient: No
Ninna: Have you used plasma-derived C1-inhibitor products for HAE prevention within the last 14 days?
Patient: No

--- 12. Recent Clinical Trial ---

Ninna: And lastly, have you participated in any other clinical research study
within the last 30 days? Observational studies might be allowed, but we'd need
to check.

Patient: No, I haven't participated in any studies at all before this one.

Ninna: Excellent. That covers all the screening questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              SUMMARY
