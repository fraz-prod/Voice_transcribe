# Background and Rationale:

Navenibart (also known as STAR-0215) is being developed as a prophylactic treatment for the prevention of HAE attacks in adults and adolescents 12 years and older living with HAE.

HAE is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by severe, recurrent, unpredictable, often painful, and sometimes life-threatening swelling in the face, limbs, abdomen, and airway (Zuraw 2008). The most common comorbidities associated with HAE include anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (Banerji 2020), and autoimmune diseases (Sundler Björkman 2022).

Most HAE cases (Type 1 and Type 2) are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene that lead to a reduction in the level or function of C1-esterase inhibitor protein (C1-INH) encoded by this gene (Busse 2021; Zuraw 2008). Fully functional C1-INH inhibits the activity of 2 key enzymes in the contact activation system, Factor XIIa and plasma kallikrein; a deficiency in the amount or function of C1-INH results in the unregulated activity of these enzymes (Craig 2012). The uninhibited activity of the contact pathway in Type 1 and Type 2 HAE leads to an unchecked and widespread surge in the production of bradykinin by plasma kallikrein, resulting in excessive and pathologic edema and pain (Zeerleder 2016).

Navenibart is a humanized IgG1 kappa light chain mAb designed to be a highly potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, thereby inhibiting the conversion of its substrate, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), to cleaved HMWK and bradykinin. The Fc domain of navenibart incorporates a 3-amino acid YTE modification designed to enhance pH-dependent neonatal Fc receptor binding and extend circulating half-life. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by navenibart is expected to reduce the cleavage of HMWK and the formation of bradykinin, thereby preventing the characteristic angioedema in HAE.

Currently approved HAE drugs are indicated either for prophylaxis or for on-demand treatment of HAE attacks. Many patients face a major challenge to achieve a satisfactory treatment strategy to prevent HAE attacks because of variable response, leading to unpredictable and incomplete attack prevention. Further, dosing and administration regimens require burdensome and often frequent procedures. Both patients and physicians report a need for less burdensome, easier-to-administer treatments (Bouillet 2022).

Initial results from clinical trials with healthy participants and participants with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile for navenibart. In ongoing trials in participants with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE, navenibart treatment at different dose levels and regimens has demonstrated robust and clinically significant reductions in frequency of HAE attacks, reduced the severity of HAE attacks, and reduced the number of HAE attacks requiring on-demand treatment. Navenibart administration also resulted in sustained inhibition of plasma kallikrein, demonstrating potential for administration once every 3 or 6 months. Nonclinical and clinical data to date support the continued development of navenibart for the prevention of HAE attacks in adolescent and adult participants.

## Trial Design:

This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navenibart compared to placebo in preventing HAE attacks in adult participants with HAE. Adolescent participants will also be enrolled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of open-label navenibart in preventing HAE attacks in adolescents with HAE. The trial will consist of a Screening Period, which includes a Screening Visit, Washout Period (for adults only), and a Run-In Period; Treatment Period; and Follow-Up Period. Participants who are willing and eligible to consent/assent may enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension (LTE) trial under a separate protocol following the 6-month Treatment Period.

## Population:

Participants 12 years of age and older with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE.

Adolescent participants will be ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years old, inclusive, at the time of informed consent/assent. Adult participants will be ≥ 18 years old at the time of informed consent.

## Stratification:

Randomization of adult participants will be stratified as follows:

- Attack rate during Run-In Period (&lt; 3 attacks per month compared to ≥ 3 attacks per month)
- Participants of Japanese ethnicity enrolled at sites in Japan versus all other participants

## Randomization, Treatment Arms, and Control Arms:

Adult participants will be randomized 3:3:3:2 to 1 of 4 dose regimens of navenibart or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by the number of attacks during the Run-In Period and by Japanese ethnicity at sites in Japan. Participants, investigators, site personnel, the Sponsor, and the trial monitor will be blinded to treatment assignments.

All adolescent participants will receive navenibart 600/300 mg every 3 months (Q3M).

# Methodology:

During all periods of the trial (from the time of informed consent/assent to the final visit), on-demand HAE attack treatment will be allowed, and participants will work with the Investigator to manage HAE attacks with protocol-permitted medications. There is no washout period for on-demand treatment.

# Screening, Washout, and Run-In

After informed consent/assent, participants will undergo screening assessments. Eligibility will be determined according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

To be eligible for the trial, participants must not have used long-term prophylaxis (LTP) for a specified amount of time before the Run-In Period (please refer to Exclusion Criterion 5). For adult participants who have been taking LTP, there will be a Washout Period of up to 90 days. The length of the Washout Period will be determined by the therapeutic class and date of last dose of the LTP. There will not be a washout period for on-demand treatment. During washout, HAE attack information will be recorded via a Sponsor-provided diary. Adolescent participants will not undergo washout as part of the trial.

Participants will enter the Run-In Period after LTP washout (as applicable for adult participants only) or commencing with screening (for adolescent participants and as applicable for adult participants). The Run-In Period is a minimum of 1 month and a maximum of 2 months and may be extended after consultation with the Medical Monitor. During the Run-In Period, HAE attack information will be recorded via a Sponsor-provided diary. Investigators will assess this information to determine whether a participant meets the eligibility requirement of experiencing $\geq 2$ investigator-confirmed HAE attacks (and an average of $\geq 1$ attack per month) during the required Run-In Period and to establish a baseline before investigational product (IP) administration.

# Treatment Period

All participants will receive 1 or 2 subcutaneous (SC) injections of IP per dose. The first dose will be administered at Month 1, Day 1, and the second dose will be administered 3 months later at Month 4, Day 91. Given that navenibart is formulated at a concentration of $150\mathrm{mg/mL}$ and IP will be delivered from a vial via a needle and syringe, $300\mathrm{mg}$ is delivered in 1 SC injection ($2\mathrm{mL}$) and $600\mathrm{mg}$ is delivered in 2 SC injections ($2\mathrm{mL}$ each). All doses of navenibart and placebo will be volume matched. Therefore, all adult participants will receive 2 injections on each dosing day (e.g., for a $300\mathrm{-mg}$ dose, 1 injection of navenibart and 1 injection of placebo). Adolescents will receive 2 injections of navenibart for the initial dose on Month 1, Day 1 and 1 injection of navenibart as the maintenance dose on Month 4, Day 91.

Assessments will be performed monthly through 3 months after the last dose of IP (End of Treatment [EoT]; Day 181). Assessments will include efficacy (HAE attack information); safety (adverse events [AEs], vital signs, electrocardiograms [ECGs], physical examinations, clinical laboratory evaluations, and pregnancy testing); pharmacokinetics (PK); pharmacodynamics (PD); immunogenicity; biomarkers; and quality-of-life evaluations.

# Follow-Up Period

At the EoT visit (Month 7, Day 181), participants who are willing and eligible to assent/consent may enroll in a Phase 3 LTE trial under a separate protocol. For participants who do not enroll in the Phase 3 LTE, safety monitoring will be performed through 9 months after the last dose of IP (Month 13) through remote contacts. Participants will have a phone visit at Month 10. Participants will return to the site for a visit at Month 13.

|  Duration of Treatment: The duration of treatment for each participant is approximately 6 months.  |
| --- |
|  Duration of Trial: The duration of participation in the trial for each adult participant may be up to 17 months, including the Screening Period (Screening, the Washout Period, and the Run-In Period), the Treatment Period, and the Follow-Up Period. The duration of participation in the trial for each adolescent participant may be up to 14 months, including the Screening Period (Screening and Run-In Period), the Treatment Period, and the Follow-Up Period. At the end of the Treatment Period (Month 7, Day 181), participants who are willing and eligible to consent/assent may enroll in a Phase 3 LTE trial under a separate protocol.  |
|  Criteria for Evaluation: Efficacy Efficacy will be assessed by collection of HAE attack frequency and accompanying information. Safety Safety will be assessed by AEs, vital sign assessments, ECG findings, physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory evaluations, including chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples will be collected to assess the plasma concentration of navenibart, which will be used with data from other trials in a population PK analysis. Pharmacodynamics Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma kallikrein inhibition and exploratory biomarkers associated with navenibart administration. Immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected to measure anti-drug (navenibart) antibodies.  |
|  Sample Size Considerations: The proposed total sample size is approximately 135 adult participants randomized 3:3:3:2 to the following dosing regimens: 600 mg every 3 months (600 mg Q3M), 600-mg loading dose with 300-mg maintenance dose (600/300 mg Q3M), 600 mg every 6 months (600 mg Q6M), or placebo. In addition, approximately 10 adolescent participants will be enrolled and treated with a 600-mg loading dose and one 300-mg maintenance dose (600/300 mg Q3M) of navenibart. The primary hypothesis will compare each active dose to placebo (36 participants in each navenibart arm compared to 24 participants in the placebo arm) and will have >90% power to detect a 60% difference from placebo in monthly HAE attack rate at the 2-sided 0.0167 significance level. The sample size estimate is based on the assumption that the occurrence of HAE attacks has a Poisson distribution with a rate of 2 in the placebo group and 0.8 in each navenibart dosing regimen, which is a conservative estimate compared to the observed normalized monthly attack rate in the STAR-0215-201 trial. The primary and secondary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical fashion within each dosing regimen, maintaining a study-wise alpha of 0.05 (0.0167 in each cohort). Analysis Populations: Efficacy Analysis Set The Efficacy Analysis Set is defined as all randomized participants. Participants will be analyzed according to the assigned treatment arm. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy endpoints.  |

# Safety Analysis Set

The Safety Analysis Set is defined as all participants who received any amount of navenibart or placebo. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all safety and immunogenicity (anti-drug antibody) endpoints.

# Per Protocol Analysis Set

The Per Protocol Analysis Set will consist of all randomized participants who received all study treatments and did not have any important protocol deviations (as determined by the Sponsor) that affect the efficacy outcome. The Per Protocol Analysis Set will be used for sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Exclusions for important protocol deviations will be determined before unblinding.

# Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set

The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set is defined as all participants who received navenibart, have ≥ 1 post-dose concentration sample available to enable assessment of navenibart concentration, and were not excluded due to important protocol deviations.

# Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set

The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set is defined as all participants who received ≥ 1 dose of navenibart or placebo and had PD assessments at baseline and ≥ 1 post-baseline visit assessment. Additionally, this analysis set will have no major protocol deviations that could affect the evaluation of PD parameters.

# Statistical Methods:

The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested using a hierarchical approach separately within each dosing regimen. The primary efficacy analyses will be performed on the Efficacy Analysis Set. No interim analyses are planned.

The primary efficacy endpoint (time-normalized rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the entire treatment period of 6 months (Month 1, Day 1 [post-dose] to EoT, Day 181) will be compared for each navenibart dosing regimen and placebo using a Poisson regression model. The time-normalized monthly HAE attack rate in the placebo group is assumed to be 2. Testing will be performed at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.0167. The stratification variable of baseline monthly attack rate will be included as a covariate, and the logarithm of duration of treatment will be included as an offset variable.

Note: Data collected at an unscheduled visit will be entered into an unscheduled eCRF.

1. The Screening Visit must be completed before Washout (if applicable) or before the Run-In Period.
2. After informed consent, there will be a Washout Period of up to 90 days for participants taking LTP. The length of the Washout Period will be determined by the therapeutic class of LTP and the date of last dose.
3. Participants must complete ≥ 1 month (≥ 30 days) of the Run-In Period. Participants may enter the Treatment Period once they experience ≥ 2 investigator-confirmed HAE attacks (and an average of ≥ 1 attack per month). The Run-In Period will be up to 2 months (≤ 60 days) but may be extended after consultation with the Medical Monitor.
4. The Follow-Up Visit and phone contact are required only for participants who do not roll over into the Phase 3 LTE trial under a separate protocol.
5. Assessments will be conducted remotely.
6. At the end of the Washout Period, participants (as applicable) will be notified that the Washout Period is ending and the Run-In Period is beginning.
7. FSH testing is performed only if needed to confirm a postmenopausal state (i.e., no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) in participants of childbearing potential not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy.
8. Participants who complete the Run-In Period and whose eligibility has been confirmed will be randomized before dosing.
9. Pregnancy testing is performed only for participants of childbearing potential. On days of IP administration, the test will be performed before dosing. Home pregnancy tests will be provided to allow for continued monthly testing in months without on-site visits.
10. Complete physical examinations will be performed at Screening and on dosing days pre-dose and 1 hour (± 15 minutes) after IP administration (before the participant leaves the clinic). All other physical examinations will be a targeted evaluation of general appearance, skin, abdomen, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
11. Height will be collected at Screening.
12. If possible, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) should be taken before blood sample collection and after the participant has been in a supine position for ≥ 5 minutes. On days of IP administration, vital signs will be taken before dosing and 1 hour (± 15 minutes) after IP administration (before the participant leaves the clinic).
13. If possible, 12-lead ECG assessments should be performed before blood sample collection. On days of IP administration, ECG assessments must be performed before IP administration. If possible, ECGs are to be performed after the participant has been in a supine position for ≥ 5 minutes.
14. Hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis parameters are outlined in Table 5. On days of IP administration, blood and urine will be collected before IP administration.
15. HAE attack information will be collected from the time of informed consent. Participants will be responsible for recording their own HAE attack information in a Sponsor-provided diary. The clinical site staff will train the participants in the use of the diary at Screening. Participants will be instructed to record information at the time they experience attacks (during or shortly after, as is practical for the participant) and will also be reminded weekly to record information, including recording the absence of attacks that week, if applicable. Ongoing review of HAE attack information as recorded in the diary will be performed by the site staff.
16. All medications administered in the 30 days before the participant provided informed consent through the final trial visit will be recorded, including non-prescription and prescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Any medications associated with the LTP of HAE attacks administered before the participant provided informed consent will also be recorded. Surgical and medical procedures, including procedures relevant to treatment of HAE attacks and/or AEs, will be recorded as detailed in Section 7.7.
17. All adverse events will be recorded from the time of informed consent through the final trial visit.
18. On days of IP administration, blood will be collected before IP administration.
19. Blood sample collection for pharmacogenetics/-omics testing is optional and requires additional participant consent.

## 2. INTRODUCTION

### 2.1. Background

#### 2.1.1. Hereditary Angioedema

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by severe, recurrent, unpredictable, often painful, and sometimes life-threatening swelling in the face, limbs, abdomen, and airway (Zuraw 2008).

The majority of HAE cases (Type 1 and Type 2) are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene that lead to a reduction in the amount (Type 1, approximately 85% of patients) or function (Type 2, approximately 15% of patients) of C1-esterase inhibitor protein (C1-INH) encoded by this gene (Zuraw 2008; Busse 2021). The process by which a deficiency in the amount or function of C1-INH leads to HAE is shown in Figure 1. Fully functional C1-INH inhibits the activity of 2 key enzymes in the contact activation system, Factor XIIa and plasma kallikrein: a deficiency in the amount or function of C1-INH results in the unregulated activity of these enzymes (Craig 2012). The uninhibited activity of the contact pathway in Type 1 and Type 2 HAE leads to an unchecked and widespread surge in the production of bradykinin by plasma kallikrein, resulting in excessive and pathologic edema and pain (Zeerleder 2016).

The estimated prevalence of Type 1 and Type 2 HAE ranges from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000, with fewer than an estimated 8,000 patients in the United States and fewer than an estimated 15,000 patients in Europe (Nzeako 2001; Lumry 2018; Busse 2021). Patients with HAE are typically diagnosed by the age of 20, and the average age of disease onset is approximately 11 years old (Christiansen 2023). Patients typically present with symptoms to the emergency department or to a primary care physician, but limited disease awareness, although improving, often precludes referrals to allergists, immunologists, and HAE specialists for diagnosis. Clinical suspicion of Type 1 or Type 2 HAE can be confirmed by available blood tests. In addition to abnormalities in C1-INH level and function, plasma complement component 4 (C4) levels are markedly reduced at all times in blood from most patients. The most common comorbidities associated with HAE include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroid disease (Sundler Björkman 2022). In addition, psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, are not uncommon but are generally considered to be caused by the burden of the disease (Banerji 2020; Lumry 2018).

## 2.1.2. Current Treatment Options for Hereditary Angioedema and Unmet Need

Current therapies can be divided into 2 general groupings: (1) historical and not mechanism-based (these include attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytics); and (2) mechanism-based (purified plasma-derived C1-INH [pdC1-INH], plasma kallikrein inhibitor, and bradykinin B2-R blocker).

Currently, approved HAE drugs are indicated either for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) or for on-demand treatment of HAE attacks.

Depending on the geographical location, the following drugs may be available for prophylactic use in patients with HAE: substituted androgen danazol, plasma derived C1-INH products (Cinryze®, Haegarda®/SC Berinert®); plasma kallikrein monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibitor (Takhzyro® [lanadelumab]); plasma kallikrein small molecule inhibitor (Orladeyo® [berotralstat]); and the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid.

Similarly, depending on the geographical location, the following drugs may be available for on-demand use in patients with HAE: plasma derived C1-INH (Berinert®); recombinant protein plasma kallikrein inhibitor (Kalbitor® [ecallantide]); bradykinin receptor antagonist (Firazyr® [icatibant]); and recombinant human C1-INH product (Ruconest®).

Despite the existence of approved therapies, many patients still face a major challenge to achieve a satisfactory treatment strategy to prevent HAE attacks. This is primarily due to patients' variable response to approved medications, which leads to unpredictable and incomplete attack

prevention. In addition, currently available dosing and administration regimens often require burdensome and frequent procedures. Both patients and physicians report a need for less burdensome, easier-to-administer treatments (Bouillet 2022).

## 2.1.3. Navenibart

Navenibart is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa light chain mAb designed to be a highly potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, thereby inhibiting the conversion of its substrate, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), to cleaved HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of navenibart incorporates a 3-amino acid tyrosine/threonine/glutamate (YTE) modification designed to enhance pH-dependent neonatal Fc receptor binding and to extend circulating half-life (t½).

Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by navenibart is expected to reduce the cleavage of HMWK and the formation of bradykinin, thereby preventing the characteristic angioedema in HAE (Figure 1).

With navenibart, the goal is to provide a safe and effective preventive treatment, with infrequent dosing, to decrease the burden of disease, as well as the burden of treatment for people with HAE.

## 2.1.4. Nonclinical Experience

Nonclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicokinetic, and toxicology profiles of navenibart. Navenibart specifically binds and inhibits the activity of its target, plasma kallikrein, without exhibiting off-target activity or enhanced potential for effector function. The high-dose level of 100 mg/kg was well tolerated in rats and monkeys and was established as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for both species. Overall, no safety issues regarding navenibart have been identified to date up to a dose of 100 mg/kg in animals. Navenibart presents a nonclinical safety profile with minimal risks, supporting the continued clinical development of navenibart.

For more details on the nonclinical evaluation of navenibart, refer to the latest edition of the Investigator's Brochure (IB).

## 2.1.5. Clinical Experience

The current clinical development program of navenibart comprises 3 clinical trials: STAR-0215-101, a Phase 1a, first-in-human (FIH) trial of navenibart in healthy adult participants conducted in the United States; STAR-0215-201, a global Phase 1b/2 single and multiple dose trial in participants with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE; and STAR-0215-202, a global Phase 2 long-term, open-label trial in participants with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. Initial results from these trials demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile, clinically relevant prevention of HAE attacks, and potential for administration every 3 or 6 months. Collectively, these results support the potential of navenibart to provide disease control and normalize the lives of HAE patients, which is the overarching goal of HAE management. Brief summaries of these clinical trials with navenibart are provided below. Please refer to the latest edition of the IB for further details.

## 2.1.5.1. STAR-0215-101

The FIH trial (STAR-0215-101) has completed dosing. A total of 41 healthy adult participants were enrolled in this single-center, Phase 1a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial evaluating navenibart administered subcutaneously (SC) and intravenously (IV). Eligible participants were randomized 3:1 to receive navenibart or placebo in 5 cohorts of 8 participants each, with dose levels of 100, 300, 600, or 1200 mg by SC administration or 600 mg by IV bolus administration, respectively.

Navenibart was generally well tolerated. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between navenibart and placebo. There were no severe events. The most common TEAEs were injection site reactions, which were all considered related to treatment and were observed only in participants who received navenibart. All injection site reactions resolved within 2 days and without intervention. There were no deaths, other serious TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to trial discontinuation. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory assessments (including activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]), vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) values (including QTcF) were observed.

PK analysis demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in navenibart exposure following SC administration. Navenibart exposure following a single dose was maintained for an extended time period, with a mean estimated t½ of up to approximately 94 days for SC administration and approximately 109 days for IV administration. The absolute bioavailability of navenibart 600 mg SC was approximately 46% to 53%.

At the 1200-mg SC and 600-mg IV navenibart dose levels, significant inhibition was observed as early as Day 4 and maintained until Day 224 when compared with placebo. At 300 and 600 mg, navenibart achieved inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity up to approximately 35% and 55%, respectively, which are consistent with levels of plasma kallikrein inhibition previously shown to prevent attacks in HAE patients (Wang 2020).

Positive anti-drug (navenibart) antibody (ADA) results were observed at baseline in 12.9% of participants who received navenibart. None of these participants had treatment-boosted ADAs after receiving their navenibart dose. ADAs were not observed in participants who received placebo. Treatment-induced ADAs were observed in 35.5% of participants who received navenibart, all observed on or after Day 140 and of low magnitude. The treatment-emergent ADAs had no effect on PK or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters.

## 2.1.5.2. STAR-0215-201

Trial STAR-0215-201 is an ongoing, Phase 1b/2, multicenter, single and multiple dose trial to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of navenibart in adult participants with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. The trial has 3 enrolled cohorts. In Cohort 1, participants received 1 SC dose of 450 mg navenibart on Day 1. In Cohort 2, participants received 1 SC dose of 600 mg navenibart on Day 1 and 1 SC dose of 300 mg navenibart on Day 84. In Cohort 3, participants received 2 single SC doses of 600 mg navenibart, the first dose on Day 1 and the second dose on Day 28. Results from an interim analysis of the ongoing STAR-0215-201 trial have demonstrated:

- Robust and clinically significant reductions in HAE attacks after single and multiple doses of navenibart for up to at least 6 months.

STAR-0215-301 v00

- PK and PD data consistent with the STAR-0215-101 Phase 1a PK and PD data in healthy adult participants. Navenibart achieved immediate absorption, rapid onset of PD effect, and slow elimination after SC administrations in all 3 cohorts.
- A favorable safety profile and an acceptable benefit-risk ratio of navenibart for participants enrolled in the ongoing clinical trials.

For more details, please refer to Section 2.3, Section 2.4, and the latest edition of the IB.

## 2.1.5.3. STAR-0215-202

Trial STAR-0215-202 is a Phase 2, long-term, open-label trial to assess the safety and efficacy of repeat dosing of navenibart for the prevention of acute attacks in adult participants with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE who completed all visits in Trial STAR-0215-201, were eligible for participation in STAR-0215-201 but were not treated with navenibart, and were navenibart-naive and were not enrolled in STAR-0215-201. This trial will provide additional support for the safety and efficacy of navenibart. For more information, please refer to the latest edition of the IB.

## 2.2. Trial Design Rationale

This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navenibart compared to placebo in preventing HAE attacks in adult participants with HAE. Adolescent participants with HAE will also be enrolled and treated with open-label navenibart; efficacy, safety, quality of life, PK, and PD will be assessed. Three dose regimens for this trial have been determined using a totality-of-evidence approach from analyses of results of ongoing trials along with evidence gained from quantitative medicine. Each regimen has high potential for efficacy and safety in HAE patients. The dose regimens are:

- 600 mg SC every 3 months (Q3M)
- 600 mg SC followed 3 months later by 300 mg SC Q3M
- 600 mg SC every 6 months (Q6M)

In this trial, adult participants will be randomized 3:3:3:2 to 1 of 4 dose regimens: 600 mg Q3M, 600/300 mg Q3M, 600 mg Q6M, or placebo. Approximately 10 adolescent participants will receive navenibart (600/300 mg Q3M).

HAE is a condition with high variability in attack frequency, attack severity, and response to treatment. The modern expectation for management of HAE requires that therapy be individualized to control the disease and normalize patients' lives (Maurer 2022). Therefore, the efficacy of 3 dose regimens, each determined to have high probability of being efficacious based on clinical and pharmacometrics data, will be confirmed in this trial. The regimens differ in their levels of administration burden, incorporating different maintenance dose levels (300 mg and 600 mg SC) as well as different administration frequencies (every 3 months and every 6 months). As demonstrated below, maintenance dose levels generally correspond to exposures, which predict clinical response at minimum drug concentration ( $C_{\min}$ ), and those clinical exposures and responses may vary by patient. HAE patients report a strong preference for infrequently administered medications (Radojicic 2021). Longer dosing intervals can potentially lessen HAE treatment burden. It is intended that clinicians use a patient-centric approach to determine the

dose regimen that provides maximum efficacy and safety while minimizing treatment burden for each patient.

## 2.3. Dose Selection Rationale

Model-informed drug development (MIDD) principles have guided the navenibart clinical program from the start, supported in large part by clinical and translational data from analogues, which are either approved or in development for HAE. This MIDD approach includes the use of exposure-response models, population PK, and quantitative systems pharmacology, all informed by HAE participant data from the STAR-0215-201 trial, to support Phase 3 dose determination.

An exposure-response model was established that relates PK measures with change in HAE attack frequency. The exposure-response relationship indicated that the probability of HAE attack protection is greater with higher minimum steady-state concentration ( $C_{\min,ss}$ ) level. The exposure-response model estimated that for an average baseline attack rate of 2 or 3 per month, a navenibart  $C_{\min,ss}$  of  $\geq 7 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$  after reaching steady state can achieve a median attack protection target of  $&lt; 0.5 / \mathrm{month}$  ( $&gt;75\%$  to  $&gt;83\%$  reduction from baseline of 2 or 3 attacks per month) and  $\geq 11 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$  after steady state can achieve an attack protection target of  $&lt; 0.25 / \mathrm{month}$  ( $&gt;88\%$  to  $&gt;92\%$  reduction from baseline of 2 or 3 attacks per month). Importantly, the model predicts a wide range of efficacy (HAE attacks per month), consistent with the variable nature of HAE attacks at concentrations lower than  $11 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$ , indicating that some individual patients experience clinical benefit at lower concentrations.

The rapid inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity within 2 weeks and achievement of steady-state PK and the target concentrations by 6 months demonstrate that a 6-month treatment period for the STAR-0215-301 may be sufficient to assess the effectiveness of navenibart in HAE. In addition, the expected median concentration after the highest dose tested (600 mg Q3M) at 9 months after the last dose in this trial is  $2.91\mu \mathrm{g / mL}$ ,  $4\%$  of predicted maximum drug concentration  $(C_{\mathrm{max}})$ , suggesting that navenibart is nearly fully eliminated by this time point. These data support the planned duration of follow-up after the last dose in this trial.

Simulations using a population pharmacokinetics (popPK) model using data from the Phase 1b/2 STAR-0215-201 trial in adults with HAE indicate that dose regimens selected for Phase 3 have the potential to be therapeutic (Figure 2). The popPK model predicts that the median  $C_{\mathrm{min}}$  at each dose interval will be within  $15\%$  of the  $C_{\mathrm{min,ss}}$  at 6 months, as shown in Table 3. The model estimates that  $C_{\mathrm{min}}$  levels will be in the therapeutic range predicted by the exposure-response model. Therefore, we anticipate that efficacy in the first 6 months will be reasonably predictive of efficacy achieved with chronic administration after 6 months.

An in silico quantitative systems pharmacology model (Chung 2023) simulating the relationship among drug concentrations, changes in PD biomarker (cHMWK levels), and HAE attacks in a virtual cohort of 500 HAE patients was used. The quantitative systems pharmacology model predicts that all 3 dose regimens will substantially reduce the time-normalized attack rate for patients. Looking specifically at the  $600/300\mathrm{-mg}$  Q3M regimen, for which correlative clinical data from STAR-0215-201 are available, the model estimates a 6-month time-normalized mean monthly HAE attack reduction of approximately  $89\%$  (baseline attack rate 2/month and 6-month time-normalized monthly attack rate 0.21/month), which aligns with the clinical data reporting time-normalized mean monthly attack rate reductions of  $84\%$  from Cohort 2 (600 mg on Day 1 and  $300\mathrm{mg}$  on Day 84) in the STAR-0215-201 trial.

To support the adolescent dosing regimen, allometric scaling based on body weight was utilized to extrapolate PK parameters from adults to adolescents. Population PK simulations suggest that  $C_{\mathrm{max}}$  and area under the curve (AUC) in adolescents will be approximately 1.6-fold and 1.4-fold higher, respectively, when compared to adults. Given the slightly higher exposures, modeling predicts that adolescents would have a higher probability of achieving the targeted HAE attack reductions with the 600/300-mg dose regimen. Based on the current model, the same dosing regimens are appropriate for adults and adolescents. However, the higher-dose regimen of 600 mg Q3M would require larger dose volumes and more injections, which may not be amenable for adolescents. Given these considerations, the adolescent dose cohort will receive the 600/300 mg Q3M dose regimen.

STAR-0215-301 v00

All 3 planned dose regimens for STAR-0215-301 are anticipated to show a statistically significant reduction in the number of time-normalized investigator-confirmed HAE attacks over the 6-month treatment period compared to placebo. The effects of navenibart at these 3 regimens over the first 6 months (the duration of the proposed treatment period of STAR-0215-301) are expected to be consistent with predicted long-term efficacy.

## 2.4. Benefit-Risk Assessment

Navenibart was designed to reduce the number and severity of HAE attacks with less frequent dosing, due to its extended half-life, than currently available prophylactic treatments for HAE (described in Section 2.1.2).

As described in Section 2.1.4 and in further detail in the IB, the navenibart nonclinical safety profile presents minimal risks and supports the continued clinical development of navenibart.

In this trial, all participants $\geq 12$ years of age will receive a starting dose of $600\,\mathrm{mg}$ navenibart or volume-matched placebo (adult participants only; adolescents will not receive placebo). A rapid onset of activity, including increased navenibart plasma concentrations in $&lt; 24$ hours, decreased cHMWK in 7 days, improvement in total Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) score, and reduction in HAE attacks, has been observed at this dose. In addition, this dose has been well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Each dosing regimen is expected to show a clinically and statistically significant difference from placebo based on the reduction in the number of time-normalized investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 6-month treatment period, as evident in the STAR-0215-201 trial and supported by modelling and simulations.

To date, no dose-limiting clinical safety signals after administration of navenibart have been observed that may be utilized to inform dose selection. In the STAR-0215-101 trial in healthy participants, compared with placebo, single doses as high as $1200\,\mathrm{mg}$ were administered, and the most common related TEAEs were mild injection site reactions (most commonly erythema). In the STAR-0215-201 trial, the highest dose regimen examined is from Cohort 3 (600 mg Day 1 and 600 mg Day 28). The most common related TEAEs were mild and moderate injection site reactions, most commonly lasting less than 2 days and resolving with no or minimal treatment. A relationship between dose and adverse event, laboratory, or ECG parameters has not been identified. Therefore, the risk-benefit balance for navenibart has remained positive, and the dose schedules that are being evaluated for the Phase 3 trial, including the 600 mg Q3M, are justified by the existing clinical data.

The benefit-risk assessment profile of navenibart remains favorable and warrants further clinical development. Please refer to the latest edition of the IB for the overall benefit-risk assessment, potential risks, and the most accurate and current information regarding metabolism, PK, clinical activity, and safety of navenibart.

# 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

# 4.1. Overall Trial Design

STAR-0215-301 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navenibart compared to placebo in preventing HAE attacks in adult participants with HAE. Adolescent participants with HAE will also be enrolled and treated with open-label navenibart.

During all periods of the trial (from the time of informed consent/assent to the final visit), on-demand HAE attack treatment will be allowed, and participants will work with the Investigator to manage HAE attacks with protocol-permitted medications as specified in Section 6.3.2. There is no washout period for on-demand treatment.

Abbreviations: EOT = end of treatment; LTP = long-term prophylaxis; QXM = every X months.

# Screening, Washout, and Run-In

After informed consent/assent, participants will undergo screening assessments. Eligibility will be determined according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, respectively).

To be eligible for the trial, participants must not have used LTP for a specified amount of time before the Run-In period (please refer to Exclusion Criterion 5). For adult participants who have been taking LTP, there will be a Washout Period of up to 90 days. The length of the Washout Period will be determined by the therapeutic class and date of last dose of the LTP. There will not be a washout period for on-demand treatment. During washout, HAE attack information will be recorded via a Sponsor-provided diary. As adolescents cannot provide consent, it is not considered appropriate to have them wash out of LTP for the purpose of participating in a clinical trial. As such, adolescent participants will not undergo washout as part of the trial, but cannot have taken LTP within the same restricted time frames prior to Run-In, as outlined in Exclusion Criterion 5.

Participants will enter the Run-In Period after LTP washout (as applicable for adult participants only) or commencing with screening (for adolescent participants and as applicable for adult participants). The Run-In Period is a minimum of 1 month and a maximum of 2 months and may

be extended after consultation with the Medical Monitor. During the Run-In Period, HAE attack information will be recorded via a Sponsor-provided diary. Investigators will assess this information to determine whether a participant meets the eligibility requirement of experiencing $\geq 2$ investigator-confirmed HAE attacks (and an average of $\geq 1$ attack per month) during the required Run-In Period and to establish a baseline before investigational product (IP) administration. Participants who do not experience at least 2 HAE attacks during the first month of the Run-In Period will remain in the Run-In Period for up to an additional month; they must experience at least 2 attacks (and an average of $\geq 1$ attack per month) during the Run-In Period to be eligible to be randomized and to enter the Treatment Period.

Randomization of adult participants will be stratified by attack rate during the Run-In Period and by participants of Japanese ethnicity enrolled at sites in Japan versus all other participants. For details of stratification, please refer Section 9.2.

## Treatment Period

All participants will receive 1 or 2 SC injections of IP per dose. The first dose will be administered at Month 1, Day 1, and the second dose will be administered 3 months later at Month 4, Day 91.

Navenibart will be administered SC into the abdominal area. Given that navenibart is formulated at a concentration of $150\mathrm{mg/mL}$ and will be delivered from a vial via a needle and syringe, $300\mathrm{mg}$ is delivered in 1 SC injection ($2\mathrm{mL}$) and $600\mathrm{mg}$ is delivered in 2 SC injections ($2\mathrm{mL}$ each). All doses of navenibart and placebo will be volume matched. Therefore, all adult participants will receive 2 injections on each dosing day (e.g., for a $300\mathrm{-mg}$ dose, 1 injection of navenibart and 1 injection of placebo). Adolescents will receive 2 injections of navenibart for the initial dose of Month 1, Day 1 and 1 injection of navenibart as the maintenance dose on Month 4, Day 91.

Participants will record any HAE attacks using the Sponsor-provided diary. Reported attacks will be reviewed by the Investigator using the HAE attack definition (Section 7.13.1).

As detailed in the Schedules of Assessments (SOAs) (Table 1 and Table 2), trial assessments will be performed monthly through 3 months after the last dose of IP (Day 181; End of Treatment [EoT]). Assessments will include safety (adverse events [AEs], vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory evaluations, and pregnancy testing); efficacy (HAE attack

information); PK; PD; immunogenicity; and quality-of-life evaluations (Bork 2021; Mendivil 2021; Craig 2023).

## Follow-Up Period

At the end of the Treatment Period, participants who are willing and eligible to assent/consent may enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension (LTE) trial under a separate protocol. For participants who do not enroll in the Phase 3 LTE trial, safety monitoring will be performed through 9 months after the last dose of IP (Month 13) through remote contacts. Participants will have a phone visit at Month 10. Participants will return to the site for a visit at Month 13.

## 4.2. Independent Data Monitoring Committee

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will independently evaluate safety data of participants enrolled in the trial. The IDMC will consist of an independent statistician, clinical specialists in the field of HAE management, and may include other clinicians with IDMC experience. The IDMC will be unblinded to support review of potential safety concerns. The IDMC is responsible for making recommendations for trial continuance with or without modification as part of their review. The structure of the committee, frequency of meetings, and responsibilities are outlined in an IDMC charter.

## 4.3. Number of Participants Planned

Approximately 185 participants will be consented and screened for this trial. Approximately 135 adult participants are planned to be randomized in this trial. In addition, approximately 10 adolescent participants who are $\geq 12$ to $&lt; 18$ years of age at the time of assent will be enrolled and treated with navenibart.

## 4.4. Duration of Treatment and Duration of Trial

Individual participants will receive 2 doses of IP (Month 1, Day 1 and Month 4, Day 91). The duration of trial participation for adult participants may be up to 17 months, including the Screening Period (Screening, Washout Period, and Run-In Period); the Treatment Period; and the Follow-Up Period. The duration of participation in the trial for each adolescent participant may be up to 14 months, including the Screening Period (Screening and Run-In Period), the Treatment Period, and the Follow-Up Period. At the end of the Treatment Period (Month 7, Day 181), participants who are willing and eligible to consent/assent may enroll in a Phase 3 LTE trial under a separate protocol.

## 4.5. End of Trial Definition

The end of the trial is defined as the date the last participant is examined for the purposes of final data collection for the overall trial.

## 4.6. Dose Interruption and Modification

Individual dose modifications are not permitted. IP administration may be interrupted and/or the second dose may be delayed if, in the opinion of the Investigator and following discussion with the Medical Monitor (time-allowing), a participant experiences a clinically significant event that poses an unacceptable risk.

## 4.7. Trial Stopping Rules and Termination

If, at any time during the trial, the IDMC identifies an important safety concern, the Sponsor may suspend dosing and/or enrollment of some or all participants. Dosing and/or enrollment will resume upon recommendation from the IDMC and approval from Sponsor after reviewing all available safety data. The trial may be modified or stopped based on IDMC review.

The Sponsor has the right to close the trial at any time for any reason. Upon trial termination, participants will still be followed for safety evaluation per trial protocol. Events that may trigger early trial termination include but are not limited to:

- Changes in the anticipated safety of navenibart
- Changes in development plans for navenibart

If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the Institutional Review Board/independent ethics committee/research ethics committee (IRB/IEC/REC), the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organizations (CROs) used in the trial of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly inform the participants and should ensure appropriate follow-up.

confirm that appropriate conditions (i.e., temperature) have been maintained during transit for all IP received and that any discrepancies have been reported and resolved before use of IP.

The Investigator acknowledges that navenibart and placebo are investigational and as such must be handled strictly in accordance with the protocol and container label. Upon receipt, navenibart and placebo must be refrigerated in a secure, environmentally controlled, and continuously monitored (manual or automated) area at 2° to 8°C. Navenibart and placebo will be maintained in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the pharmacist or designated site staff.

Only eligible participants may receive the IP, only the unblinded pharmacist or designated site staff may prepare it, and only unblinded qualified administrators may administer it.

Navenibart and placebo are preservative-free and provided in single-use vials. The appropriate dose will be prepared by the unblinded pharmacist or designated site staff. A syringe will be filled with the prepared dose solution for administration. IP must be administered to the participant within the 4 hours after the vial closure integrity is breached. Complete instructions for the preparation and administration of IP are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.

The Investigator is responsible for IP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).

All used, unused, or expired IP may be returned to the Sponsor or the Sponsor's designee or, if authorized by the Sponsor, disposed of at the trial site per the site's standard operating procedures and documented.

Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused IP are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.

## 6.3. Prior and Concomitant Medications

All medications administered in the 30 days before the participant provided informed consent/assent through the final trial visit will be recorded. This includes non-prescription and prescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Any medications associated with the LTP of HAE attacks administered before the participant provided informed consent/assent will also be recorded.

## 6.3.1. Prohibited Medications

Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the trial:

- LTP for HAE (C1-INH products, kallikrein inhibitors, attenuated androgens, antifibrinolytics, or any other therapies approved as LTP for HAE during this trial). For participants who do not enroll in the Phase 3 LTE trial, LTP for HAE is permitted after the end of the Treatment Period (Month 7, Day 181).
- ACE inhibitors
- Estrogen-containing medications with systemic absorption (such as hormonal contraceptives or HRT). Estrogens applied externally (topically) or intravaginally are allowed, provided that the Investigator and Medical Monitor agree that the systemic absorption is minimal and unlikely to have adverse health impacts to the participant.

- Androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestosterone, or testosterone)
- Any investigational drug or device
- Vaccine doses within the 7 days before or after IP administration

## 6.3.2. Permitted Medications

All medications not specified in Section 6.3.1 are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. Vaccinations are allowed per local guidelines and regulations; there is a timing restriction for vaccine doses with respect to IP administration (Section 6.3.1), which is also specified in the inclusion criteria (Section 5.1). Local anesthetic creams are permitted for trial-related blood draws and other procedures not related to the trial.

If a participant experiences HAE attacks during the trial or requires pre-procedural prophylaxis, they will be permitted standard-of-care on-demand treatment or short-term prophylaxis, respectively, as prescribed by their physician. In some regions, standard-of-care, as prescribed by the physician, may include a treatment that is not approved by local authorities. The date and time of each use of on-demand treatment or short-term prophylaxis, as well as the name and dosage regimen of the treatment, must be recorded. On-demand treatment will be provided and/or reimbursed per local procedures.

For participants who do not enroll in the LTE trial, long-term prophylaxis is permitted after the EoT visit (3 months after the last dose of IP; Day 181).

## 6.4. Randomization and Blinding

Adult participants will receive double-blinded treatment in this trial. Adult participants will be randomized 3:3:3:2 to 1 of 4 dose regimens: navenibart 600 mg Q3M, navenibart 600/300 Q3M, navenibart 600 mg Q6M, or placebo. At each clinical site, an unblinded pharmacist or designated site staff will be assigned to prepare the IP (navenibart or placebo). An unblinded qualified administrator will administer the IP to all participants, including adolescents. At the site, dosing regimen assignments will be made available only to the unblinded pharmacist or designated site staff dispensing the IP. Unblinded site personnel will be trained to ensure that the double-blind is maintained.

The Investigator, remaining trial staff, participants, Sponsor, and trial monitor will be blinded to treatment assignments. IP and placebo will be packaged in the same way.

Treatment assignment for an individual participant should be unblinded by the Investigator only in an emergency, and only if knowledge of the treatment assignment is urgently needed for the clinical management or welfare of the participant. The randomization code will be made available only to the unblinded pharmacist or designated site staff dispensing the IP. Unblinding at the trial site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. The Investigator is encouraged to contact the Sponsor before unblinding any participant's treatment assignment, but priority should be given to the safety of the participant.

Details regarding randomization and blinding procedures and documentation are available in the Pharmacy Manual, as applicable.

## 6.5. Treatment Compliance

IP supplied for the trial may not be used for any purpose other than the trial or administered other than as described in this protocol.

Under no circumstances is the Investigator allowed to release IP supplies to any physician not named in the Food and Drug Administration Form 1572 or equivalent form, or to administer these supplies to a patient not enrolled in this trial. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for further details.

When participants are dosed at the site, IP will be administered by qualified site personnel designated by the Investigator. The date, time, and volume of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents.

## 6.6. Contraception and Pregnancy

The effects of navenibart on conception, pregnancy, and lactation are unknown.

Participants are exempt from contraception requirements during the trial if they are practicing complete abstinence as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle, defined as intentionally refraining from heterosexual intercourse. Investigators are expected to discuss lifestyle and contraceptive measures with all participants, including adolescents who have undergone menarche or who are capable of producing sperm.

## 6.6.1. Definition of Participant of Childbearing Potential

Participants are considered to be of childbearing potential at the time of menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes), a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before IP administration, and a participant is not practicing an abstinent lifestyle, contraceptive measures must be undertaken as if the participant is of childbearing potential. If childbearing potential status changes during the trial (e.g., an adolescent experiences menarche, an adult becomes sterile or becomes confirmed menopausal), contraceptive requirements will be readdressed accordingly.

Documentation is defined as the participant's medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.

A participant is not considered capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following conditions apply:

1. Premenarchal
2. Premenopausal with 1 of the following:

- Documented hysterectomy
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy or ligation
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy

For premenopausal participants with permanent infertility due to a medical cause other than the above (e.g., mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion should be applied.

3. Postmenopausal, as defined by at least 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (&gt; 40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in participants in whom menopausal status is unclear and who are not using hormonal contraception or HRT.

Note: Participants on HRT whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non-estrogen-containing hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their (non-estrogen containing) HRT during the trial; otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before trial enrollment.

## 6.6.2. Contraception Requirements

Participants of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the trial through 9 months after last IP administration.

Participants capable of producing sperm who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the trial through 9 months after last IP administration.

Participants must refrain from egg or sperm donation and cryopreservation of cells during treatment and until the end of the contraception requirement. If needed, participants should seek advice about egg or sperm donation and cryopreservation prior to treatment.

Highly Effective Methods of Contraception (CTFG 2024):

- Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, which may be oral, injectable, or implantable
- Intrauterine device (IUD)
- Intrauterine hormone-releasing system
- Bilateral tubal occlusion
- Azoospermic participant or partner (vasectomized or due to a medical cause)
- Azoospermia is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the azoospermic individual is the sole sexual partner of the participant capable of becoming pregnant and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
- Documentation of azoospermia for a participant capable of producing sperm can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.

In addition to the above methods, participants’ partners of childbearing potential may use highly effective methods of contraception containing both estrogens and progestins (oral, transdermal, or via vaginal ring) associated with inhibition of ovulation.

Participants are exempt from contraception requirements if they are practicing complete abstinence, only in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, defined as intentionally refraining from heterosexual intercourse.

Docusign Envelope ID: B5870065-AE8C-40F2-A11A-80350E41BE2D

Astria Therapeutics, Inc.

STAR-0215-301 v00

Any form of contraception not outlined above is not considered highly effective and is inadequate for participation in this trial. Unacceptable methods include but are not limited to: periodic or situational abstinence, natural family planning (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal, spermicides only, condoms only, condoms plus spermicides, and lactational amenorrhea.

## 6.7. Overdose

An overdose is defined as a significant excess quantity from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a product. The dosing for this trial will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting, and an overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this trial, a dose that is &gt;1200 mg over a 4-week period is considered an overdose of navenibart, regardless of the participant’s treatment arm assignment. Receipt of dose(s) at levels in excess of intended dose(s) will be captured as protocol deviation(s).

If an overdose of navenibart were to occur during the trial, the participant should be observed closely for signs of toxicity (including measures of coagulation parameters such as aPTT), and appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.

## 6.8. Continued Access to Investigational Product After the End of the Trial

Participants who complete the EoT visit on Day 181 may be eligible to participate in a Phase 3 LTE trial under a separate protocol.

# 7. TRIAL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES

Trial procedures and their timing are outlined in the SOAs (Table 1 and Table 2). If necessary to facilitate a participant’s continued participation, alternative methods for trial visits and safety assessments may be implemented, which may include remote or virtual trial visits and assessments per site standard practice and local regulations.

# 7.1. Informed Consent/Assent

Informed consent or assent will be obtained before any trial procedures are performed. If applicable, participants under the age of 18 years must also have a signed parent/legal guardian consent.

# 7.2. Screening/Eligibility

All screening evaluations must be completed and documented by the Investigator during the Screening Period, which includes a Screening Visit, Washout Period (adults only, as applicable), and Run-In Period. The Investigator will confirm the participant’s eligibility before the first administration of IP.

Screen failures are defined as participants who provide informed consent/assent to participate in the clinical trial but who do not meet the eligibility criteria for participation in this trial. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial may be rescreened once after consultation with the Medical Monitor, provided that the reason for screen failure is considered transient and likely to change before rescreening. If a participant is rescreened within 30 days of the date of screen failure, the following screening assessments do not need to be repeated unless they were the cause of the screen failure: chemistry, hematology, and virus serology laboratory evaluations. Screening laboratory evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator.

# 7.3. Diagnosis and History of Hereditary Angioedema

Diagnosis of HAE will be based on clinical history, age of onset of first angioedema symptoms, and blood tests of C1-INH antigen or functional level and C4 level. Testing for C1-INH and C4 will be performed according to the central laboratory’s standard procedure.

If the C1-INH functional level by enzyme immunoassay does not qualify a participant with known or clinically suspected Type 2 HAE for trial eligibility, a chromogenic assay may be obtained after discussion with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. If approved beforehand, the Sponsor will pay for the chromogenic assay.

Date of diagnosis, age at onset of symptoms, and type of HAE (1 or 2) will be collected. Historical HAE attack information, which includes the number and location of HAE attacks and any medications associated with the LTP of HAE attacks prior to Screening, will be collected at Screening.

## 7.4. Virus Serology

Blood tests for virus serology (HCV, HBsAg, and HIV) all must be confirmed negative, with 2 exceptions:

- For HCV Ab positive, if the participant is cured of HCV infection and this is documented in the medical record
- For HIV positive, if the participant is compliant on antiretroviral therapy with a CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/μL and HIV RNA ≤ 500 copies/mL within the past year, as confirmed by their treating provider.

Testing will be performed according to the central laboratory’s standard procedures.

## 7.5. Physical Examination

A complete or targeted physical examination will be conducted by the Investigator or their qualified designee. Weight will also be collected. For adult participants, height will be collected at Screening only. For adolescent participants, height will be collected at Screening and the Month 4 visit. The complete physical examination will be performed at Screening and on dosing days pre-dose and 1 hour (± 15 minutes) after IP administration and will include general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; neck; abdomen; and respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, musculoskeletal, and dermatologic systems. Targeted physical examinations will include the evaluation of general appearance, skin, abdomen, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

## 7.6. Demographics/Medical History

Where applicable, demographics as allowed by local legislation (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and medical history will be obtained from the participant. Medical history will capture the participant’s current medical status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease processes), and allergies.

## 7.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures

Any medications associated with the LTP of HAE attacks administered before the participant provided informed consent/assent will be recorded.

All medications administered in the 30 days before the participant provided informed consent/assent through the final trial visit will be recorded. This includes non-prescription and prescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Surgical and medical procedures occurring prior to informed consent/assent that are considered clinically relevant (i.e., major procedures that could impact health during the trial) will be reported on a Prior and Concomitant Procedures electronic case report form (eCRF). Surgical procedures occurring from the time of informed consent/assent to the final trial visit will also be reported on a Prior and Concomitant Procedures eCRF. Medical procedures that are relevant to the treatment of HAE attacks and/or AEs will also be documented.

## 7.8. Vital Signs

Vital signs will be measured by the Investigator or their qualified designee. If possible, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) should be taken before blood sample collection and after the participant has been in a supine position for ≥ 5 minutes. On days of IP administration, vital signs will be taken before dosing and 1 hour (± 15 minutes) after IP administration (before the participant leaves the clinic).

## 7.9. Electrocardiograms

If possible, 12-lead ECG assessments should be performed before blood sample collection. On days of IP administration, ECG assessments must be performed before dosing. If possible, ECGs are to be performed after the participant has been in a supine position for ≥ 5 minutes.

## 7.10. Clinical Laboratory Assessments

All clinical laboratory assays (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be performed according to the central laboratory’s normal procedures. Reference ranges are to be supplied by the laboratory and will be used to assess the clinical laboratory data for out-of-range pathological changes. Abnormal clinical laboratory values that are unexpected or not explained by the participant’s clinical condition may, at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained, or resolved.

Clinical laboratory parameters are listed in Table 5.

## 7.11. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Test

Testing for FSH is performed only if needed to confirm a postmenopausal state (i.e., no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) in participants of childbearing potential not using hormonal contraception or HRT. Testing will be performed according to the central laboratory's standard procedures.

## 7.12. Pregnancy Testing

A serum human gonadotropin pregnancy test will be performed for participants of childbearing potential during the following visits: Screening Visit, Month 2, Month 6, Month 7, Month 13 (for participants who do not roll over to the Phase 3 LTE trial), and early termination. At all other visits, urine pregnancy tests will be conducted. Home pregnancy tests will be provided to allow for continued monthly testing in months without on-site visits and should be completed and

reported each month. Testing will be performed according to the laboratory’s standard procedures. On days of IP administration, the test will be performed before dosing.

## 7.13. Hereditary Angioedema Attack Information

HAE attacks will be assessed throughout the trial to evaluate the efficacy of navenibart.

HAE attack information will be collected from the time of informed consent/assent. Participants will be responsible for recording their own HAE attack information weekly in a Sponsor-provided diary. The clinical site staff will train the participant in the use of the diary at Screening. The HAE attack information collected during the Run-In Period will be used to establish a participant’s eligibility and baseline. Participants will be instructed to record information as they experience attacks (during or shortly after, as is practical for the participant) and will also be reminded weekly to record information, including recording the absence of attacks that week, if applicable. HAE attack information as recorded in the diary will be reviewed at each scheduled visit.

Investigators will assess this collected information against the HAE attack definition (Section 7.13.1) to confirm occurrence of HAE attacks. The clinical information related to any HAE attacks that will be collected will include, but not be limited to, attack location, severity, time of onset, duration of attack, hospitalization status, and treatment with any acute on-demand therapy.

If a participant records an HAE attack in the diary, the site will be notified, and the PI will follow up with the participant within 72 hours. Participants who experience HAE attacks during the trial will be permitted standard-of-care on-demand treatment as prescribed by their healthcare provider (Section 6.3.2). A washout period for on-demand treatment is not required.

Guidance on the collection of HAE attack information with respect to AE collection is provided in Section 8.2.1.

## 7.13.1. HAE Attack Definition

Defining an event as an HAE attack will be based on an assessment of the signs and symptoms of an event against predefined criteria and Investigator clinical judgment.

For an event to be considered an HAE attack, the Investigator must confirm that the event has signs or symptoms consistent with an HAE attack (with no alternative explanation) in 1 or more anatomical locations, as follows:

- Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, and/or genitourinary region
- Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, without a plausible alternative cause
- Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx

Additionally, the Investigator will employ his/her clinical judgment to evaluate other features of the event before confirming that an HAE attack has occurred. All attacks should entail noticeable swelling and/or discomfort. Examples of features that may lead to an event not being confirmed

as an HAE attack are symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack, the event’s duration being longer than typical for an HAE attack, or the event having a plausible alternative etiology.

Prodromal symptoms or participant-reported use of on-demand HAE attack treatment alone are not sufficient to define an event as an HAE attack.

Each HAE attack must be unique. To be distinct from the previous attack, the new symptoms must occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.

HAE attack resolution is defined as the participant no longer having symptoms of the HAE attack.

HAE attack severity will be graded by the Investigator per the following definitions:

- Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity
- Moderate: Some limitation in activity, some assistance with daily activities needed
- Severe: Marked limitation in activity, assistance with daily activities required

## 7.14. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Immunogenicity, and Exploratory Biomarker Assessments

Blood samples for PK, PD, immunogenicity, and exploratory biomarkers will be collected for assessment of trial objectives. Remaining samples or remaining volumes of samples may undergo additional testing for future research if the participant provides additional consent/assent for this testing (Section 12.6.1). Use of samples for future research and sample retention is described in more detail in Section 12.6.

A full description of the blood collections, handling, storage, and shipping can be found in the Laboratory Manual.

## 7.14.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments

Plasma samples will be collected for measurement of navenibart according to the SOAs. The date and time (24-hour clock) will be recorded for each sample.

The concentration of navenibart will be measured using the most current validated bioanalytical method.

## 7.14.2. Pharmacodynamic Assessments (Plasma Kallikrein)

PD blood samples will be obtained to evaluate plasma kallikrein inhibition due to navenibart administration. The samples will be evaluated using an appropriately validated assay to measure plasma kallikrein activity.

## 7.14.3. Immunogenicity

ADAs will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all participants according to the SOAs.

Serum samples will be screened for ADA. The signal-to-noise ratio from the screening titer and titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to further characterize the immunogenicity of navenibart.

The detection and characterization of antibodies to navenibart will be measured using the most current validated bioanalytical method.

## 7.14.4. Exploratory Biomarkers

Blood will be collected for assessment of biomarkers related to the disease or navenibart mechanism of action, disease progression, or therapeutic effect of navenibart. It is possible that not all assays will be performed at each timepoint. Decisions to perform assays will be made based on considerations that include statistical and scientific planning, available technologies, and trial outcomes.

## 7.14.4.1. Serum/Plasma Biomarkers

Mechanistic and disease biomarkers may be evaluated in serum and plasma. These evaluations may provide a better understanding of the disease mechanism of action or factors related to an HAE attack, as well as biomarkers that may change as a result of navenibart administration or that affect the response to navenibart. Assessments may include, but are not limited to, plasma kallikrein and prekallikrein concentrations in circulation, alternative measures of plasma kallikrein activity, functional C1-INH levels over time, bradykinin levels, and other biomarkers in the contact activation, complement, coagulation, or fibrinolysis pathways or other related disease pathways.

Serum/plasma biomarkers will not be collected in adolescent participants who weigh &lt; 42 kg at the time of screening.

## 7.14.4.2. Transcriptomics (RNA)

Whole blood samples will be collected in a PAXgene® blood RNA tube to isolate RNA for assessing expression levels of genes or pathways associated with HAE, such as the contact activation or complement pathway, or expression transcripts that may change in response to navenibart administration. These assessments may be performed using technologies such as microarray and RNA sequencing or other sequencing technologies.

## 7.14.4.3. Pharmacogenetics/-omics (DNA; Optional)

With participant consent, whole blood will be collected in a PAXgene® blood DNA tube for pharmacogenetic/-omic assessments, including genetic polymorphisms (baseline) and epigenetic modifications that are associated with HAE, impact a participant's response to navenibart, or result from navenibart administration. Pharmacogenetics/-omics sample collection is optional for adult participants only (i.e., it will not be performed in adolescent participants) and requires a separate specific consent.

HAE cases (Type 1 and Type 2) are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene that lead to a reduction in the amount or function of C1-INH encoded by this gene. Variants in the SERPING1 gene or other genes in the contact activation, kinin, coagulation, or related pathways have been shown to influence the severity of HAE (Parsopoulou 2022; Porebski 2021). The assessment of epigenetics (such as DNA methylation) and genetic variation in genes related to HAE etiology or drug disposition may be beneficial in understanding participant response to navenibart administration. Whole genome sequencing will not be performed.

## 7.15. Patient-Reported Outcomes

Patient-reported outcomes will be collected remotely or in the clinic. During clinic visits and phone contacts, patient-reported outcomes should be collected before any other interactions with the participant about their health status and before review of their diary.

## 7.15.1. Angioedema Quality of Life

The AE-QoL (Weller 2020) is a validated, angioedema-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. It is a 17-item questionnaire covering 4 domains (functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and nutrition).

## 7.15.2. Angioedema Control Test

The Angioedema Control Test (AECT) is a validated patient-reported outcome measure to assess disease control in patients with angioedema (Weller 2020). It is a 4-item questionnaire.

## 7.15.3. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication

The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is a validated, patient-reported outcome measure to assess patient satisfaction with medication (Atkinson 2004). It is a 14-item questionnaire.

## 7.15.4. EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level

The EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a validated patient-reported outcome measure to assess participant quality of life.

## 7.15.5. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health

The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI:GH) is an instrument to measure impairments in work or school (Reilly 1993).

## 7.15.6. End of Treatment Survey

The End of Treatment Survey is a Sponsor-developed questionnaire that participants will complete at the End of Treatment visit to help identify areas for improvement and support outcomes.

## 7.16. Follow-Up Assessments

For participants who are willing and eligible to consent/assent to the Phase 3 LTE trial (STAR-0215-302), trial assessments will be performed through 3 months after the last dose of IP (EoT; Day 181). For participants who do not enroll in the Phase 3 LTE trial, safety monitoring will be performed through 9 months after the last dose of IP (Month 13) through remote contacts. Remote contacts will collect information on any AEs (including HAE attacks), concomitant medication, and any pregnancy information for participants of childbearing potential.

Participants will be contacted by phone at Month 10 to record AEs, concomitant medications and procedures, and monthly urine pregnancy tests. Participants will return to the site for a visit at Month 13.

# 8. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS

## 8.1. Overview of Safety Monitoring

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to oversee the safety of all participants at their trial site and to report all AEs, including serious adverse events (SAEs), that are observed or reported during the trial, regardless of the relationship to IP (as assessed by the Investigator) or clinical significance of these events.

## 8.2. Adverse Event Definitions

### 8.2.1. Adverse Event Definition

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.

Laboratory and ECG abnormalities are generally not considered AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention. A clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormality that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to IP interruption or discontinuation, will be considered an AE.

If a participant experiences symptoms that support an HAE attack, those symptoms/attacks will not be reported as AEs. However, if those symptoms are not supportive of an HAE attack, they will be reported as AEs. Any HAE attack that meets the definition of an SAE (Section 8.2.2) will be captured as an SAE.

For participants who do not enroll in the Phase 3 extension trial and experience HAE attacks after 3 months following the last dose of IP, those attacks will be reported as AEs.

### 8.2.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that meets at least 1 of the criteria listed:

- Results in death
- Is immediately life-threatening
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
- Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect
- Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above

## 8.2.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest

An AE of special interest (AESI) (serious or non-serious) is an AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor is appropriate. The Sponsor has identified the following TEAEs as AESIs (also see Table 6):

- Injection site reactions
- Bleeding events
- Hypersensitivity reactions

AESIs that are also SAEs must be reported as both and within 24 hours of awareness.

Table 6: Navenibart AEs of Special Interest

|  AESI | Description  |
| --- | --- |
|  Injection site reactions | ISRs may include multiple signs and symptoms that arise after IP SC injection. Each instance of an ISR will be recorded as a single AE on the AE eCRF. The individual signs and symptoms of an ISR and the severity of each sign and symptom will be recorded on the ISR eCRF. The severity of the ISR on the AE form will be recorded as the highest severity grade assigned across the individual signs and symptoms.  |
|  Bleeding events | Clinically relevant bleeding events are defined as the internal or external loss of blood as diagnosed by the Investigator. Minimal prolongation of aPTT has been observed in nonclinical studies. Although aPTT prolongation may be an artifactual, in vitro effect due to plasma kallikrein inhibition, investigators will report all bleeding events or individual signs and symptoms that are consistent with a clinical event of bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when temporally reasonable, with reports of moderate to severe bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly indicative of bleeding.  |
|  Hypersensitivity events | Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity are extensive and include bronchospasm, angioedema, hypotension, loss of consciousness, generalized skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed for monoclonal antibodies as a class. Investigators will report all events of hypersensitivity reactions or individual signs and symptoms when a diagnosis of hypersensitivity cannot be determined.  |

Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; AESI = adverse event of special interest; aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time; eCRF = electronic case report form; INR = international normalized ratio; IP = investigational product; ISR = injection site reaction; PT = prothrombin time; SC = subcutaneous.

## 8.3. Relationship to Investigational Product

The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to IP for each AE. Association of AEs and SAEs to IP will be made using the following definitions:

Unrelated: An AE that is not related to the use of the IP.

CONFIDENTIAL

Docusign Envelope ID: B5870065-AE8C-40F2-A11A-80350E41BE2D

Astria Therapeutics, Inc.

STAR-0215-301 v00

Unlikely: An AE that is unlikely to be due to the use of the IP. An alternative explanation (e.g., concomitant drug[s] or concomitant disease[s]) is plausible. A relationship to the IP is improbable but not impossible.

Possible: An AE that conceivably could be due to the use of the IP. An alternative explanation (e.g., concomitant drug[s] or concomitant disease[s]) is not conclusive. The relationship of the event in time follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the IP, so that a causal relationship cannot be excluded, but the event could have been produced by the participant's clinical condition or other therapy.

Probable: An AE that might be due to the use of the IP. An alternative explanation is less likely (e.g., concomitant drug[s] or concomitant disease[s]). The relationship in time is suggestive and follows a reasonable temporal association with IP administration. The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the participant's clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the participant.

Related: An AE that is almost certainly related to the use of the IP. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation (e.g., concomitant drug[s] or concomitant disease[s]) and follows a clear temporal association with IP administration.

For purposes of assigning relatedness, "Unrelated" and "Unlikely" will be considered not related. "Possible," "Probable," and "Related" will be considered related.

# 8.4. Assessment of Severity

It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 8.2.2. An AE of severe intensity may or may not be considered serious.

The severity of AEs will be graded with a scale appropriate for use with people with HAE who are otherwise generally healthy individuals. Guidance for assessment of specific signs, symptoms, diagnoses, and laboratory findings is in Appendix 1. Any AE not listed in Appendix 1 will be graded as follows:

Table 7: Guide for Grading Adverse Event Severity

|  Severity | Definition | Grade  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Mild | Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated1 | 1  |
|  Moderate | Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated1; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living | 2  |
|  Severe | Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated1; disabling; limited self-care activities of daily living | 3  |
|  Life-threatening | Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated1 | 4  |
|  Fatal | Death related to an adverse event | 5  |

1 Indicated" means an intervention is recommended by a healthcare provider and is considered necessary for resolution of the event.

STAR-0215-301 v00

Injection site reaction severity will be graded based on the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, September 2007 (FDA 2007) (Appendix 1).

## 8.5. Recording Adverse Events

AEs spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question from the trial personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the trial by the investigational site staff.

The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. Additionally, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as 1 comprehensive event or diagnosis. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date), resolution (date), severity, relationship, action taken, seriousness, outcome (if applicable), and whether it caused the participant to discontinue the trial.

At each visit, and particularly at the participant's final trial visit, the investigator should review any ongoing AEs to confirm ongoing status.

SAEs that are not resolved by the end of the trial, or that were not resolved upon early discontinuation from the trial, are to be followed until 1 of the following occurs:

- the event resolves
- the participant's condition stabilizes or is fully characterized
- the event returns to baseline value (if a baseline value is available)

## 8.6. Reporting Adverse Events

All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or relationship to IP, will be recorded on the AE eCRF in the electronic data capture (EDC) system throughout the trial.

All AEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF)/assent through the last trial visit.

Please refer to Section 8.2.3 for information regarding AESIs for this trial.

SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent/assent through the end of trial visit (Month 13, Day 361) for participants who do not roll over into the Phase 3 LTE trial, or through Day 181 for participants who roll over into the Phase 3 LTE trial. All SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of awareness of the event. The Investigator must verify the accuracy of the information recorded for the SAE with the corresponding source documents.

Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow-up information) will be collected and recorded in English on the SAE eCRF within the EDC system. The Investigator will assess the relationship to IP. If the event meets seriousness criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, a paper SAE Report Form will be sent to the pharmacovigilance (PV) CRO via email or fax (refer to the site manual for contact information). When the EDC system becomes available, the SAE information will be entered within 24 hours.

The Investigator will report follow-up information relating to an SAE to the PV CRO within 24 hours of awareness by updating the eCRF with the new information or by submitting a paper

SAE Report Form in the event that the EDC system is not available. When the EDC system becomes available, the site must enter the SAE information within 24 hours. The participant will be observed and monitored carefully until the condition resolves or stabilizes.

The Investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE pages/screens and verify the accuracy of the information recorded with the corresponding source documents.

Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be recorded within 24 hours of receipt.

The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events. The Investigator will receive prompt notification of any adverse experience related to IP that is both serious and unexpected or any finding that suggests a significant risk for participants. The Investigator will promptly inform their IRB/IEC/REC of the notification and insert the notification in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder in accordance with country-specific submission requirements for notification to the competent authority (refer to Section 12.1 for additional Investigator responsibilities pertaining to these events).

## 8.7. Expedited Safety Reports

To determine reporting requirements for single AE cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness of these events using the reference safety information in the navenibart IB. Additionally, reporting requirements to the relevant regulatory authorities will be based on the Investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading AEs to serious and related by the Sponsor as needed.

Reportable events (e.g., suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [SUSARs]) will be reported to relevant competent authorities and Ethics Committees and all Investigators by the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s appointed representative in line with pertinent requirements.

If required, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the local Ethics Committee of all SAEs and SUSARs in accordance with the local Ethics Committee’s SAE reporting policy.

## 8.8. Pregnancy

Pregnancy is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that an IP may have interfered with the efficacy of contraceptive medication. However, any pregnancy that occurs during a clinical trial using an investigational drug must be reported. Details of pregnancies in participants of childbearing potential and participants’ non-same-sex partners who are of childbearing potential will be recorded and followed to determine the outcome (including spontaneous abortion, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and the status of mother and child, even if the participant was discontinued from the trial. The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator will report the pregnancy information to the Sponsor or designee via the paper Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of learning of the participant’s or participant’s partner’s pregnancy (after obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the participant’s partner).

## 8.9. Medical Safety Monitoring

### 8.9.1. Medical Monitor

The trial Medical Monitor has medical authority to evaluate the safety aspects of the clinical trial and may be a Sponsor representative or a representative of a CRO if this obligation is transferred. Investigators may contact the Medical Monitor with specific medical questions about the trial protocol, participant eligibility, or for discussion of AEs. Contact information for the Medical Monitor will be provided separately.

# 9. STATISTICAL METHODS

## 9.1. Statistical Considerations

This section outlines the core elements of the planned statistical summaries and analyses for the data collected in this trial. Details regarding the management of all data and statistical methodology, including an explanation of the analyses of exploratory endpoints and sensitivity analyses, will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock. The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary estimand definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. If changes are made to the SAP after the database is locked, these deviations will be documented in the clinical study report (CSR). No interim analyses are planned.

Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) or frequency counts and percentages, as appropriate. Results will be presented by treatment group. Adolescent participants will be summarized separately.

## 9.2. Hypotheses and Analyses

The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the time-normalized rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the entire treatment period of 6 months (Month 1, Day 1 [post-dose] to EoT, Day 181) between each navenibart dosing regimen and placebo using a Poisson regression model. The time-normalized monthly HAE attack rate in the placebo group is assumed to be 2. Testing will be performed at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.0167. The stratification variable of baseline monthly attack rate will be included as a covariate, and the logarithm of duration of treatment will be included as an offset variable.

Subgroup analyses will include summaries by age, sex, race, and ethnicity for the primary and secondary endpoints.

All data collected from adolescent participants (≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age at the time of informed consent/assent) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.

## 9.3. Sample Size Determination

The proposed total sample size is approximately 135 adult participants, randomized 3:3:3:2 to the following dosing regimens: 600 mg every 3 months (600 mg Q3M), 600-mg loading dose with 300-mg maintenance dose (600/300 Q3M), 600 mg every 6 months (600 mg Q6M), or placebo. In addition, approximately 10 adolescent participants will be enrolled and treated with a 600-mg loading dose and one 300-mg maintenance dose (600/300 mg Q3M) of navenibart.

The primary hypothesis will compare each active dose to placebo (36 adult participants in each active treatment arm compared to 24 adult participants in the placebo arm) and will have &gt; 90% power to detect a 60% difference from placebo in monthly HAE attack rate at the 2-sided 0.0167 significance level.

The sample size estimate is based on the assumption that the occurrence of HAE attacks has a Poisson distribution with a rate of 2 in the placebo group and 0.8 in each navenibart dosing regimen, which is a conservative estimate compared to the observed normalized monthly attack

rate in the STAR-0215-201 trial. The primary and secondary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical fashion within each dosing regimen, maintaining a study-wise alpha of 0.05 (0.0167 in each cohort).

## 9.4. Analysis Sets

### 9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis Set

The Efficacy Analysis Set is defined as all randomized participants. Participants will be analyzed according to the assigned treatment arm. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy endpoints.

### 9.4.2. Safety Analysis Set

The Safety Analysis Set is defined as all participants who received any amount of navenibart or placebo. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment received. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all safety and immunogenicity (ADA) endpoints.

### 9.4.3. Per Protocol Analysis Set

The Per Protocol Analysis Set will consist of all randomized participants who received all study treatments and did not have any important protocol deviations (as determined by the Sponsor) that affect the efficacy outcome. The Per Protocol Analysis Set will be used for sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Exclusions for important protocol deviations will be determined before unblinding.

### 9.4.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set

## 9.5.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

Descriptive statistics of participant demographics as allowed by local legislation (age, sex, ethnicity, and race) and baseline characteristics and vital signs (height, body weight, body mass index [BMI], HAE type and history, and medical history) will be summarized by treatment arm for the Efficacy, Safety and Per Protocol analysis sets (if different). Adolescent participants will be summarized separately.

## 9.6. Efficacy Analysis

### 9.6.1. Statistical Hypotheses

The primary hypothesis to be tested is whether or not there is a difference between the monthly HAE attack rate between Day 1 and EoT (Day 181) between each navenibart dosing regimen and placebo. The statistical hypothesis is as follows:

$\mathrm{H_0}$: $\mu_{\text{havenibart}} - \mu_{\text{placebo}} = 0$ versus $\mathrm{H_a}$: $\mu_{\text{havenibart}} - \mu_{\text{placebo}} \neq 0$

Where $\mu_{\text{havenibart}} - \mu_{\text{placebo}}$ are the time-normalized number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month (attack rate) through the EoT (Day 181). Following rejection of the primary null hypothesis, sequential testing will be performed for the following 6 secondary endpoints:

- The number of moderate or severe investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 6-month Treatment Period
- The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks that require on-demand treatment during the 6-month Treatment Period
- Percent reduction in monthly investigator-confirmed HAE attacks in the 6-month Treatment Period versus the Run-In Period
- Time to first investigator-confirmed HAE attack after first and second dose
- The number of participants with $\geq 50\%$, $\geq 70\%$, and $\geq 90\%$ reduction in the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month versus the Run-In Period during the 6-month Treatment Period
- The number of participants with no investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 6-month Treatment Period

Testing of the secondary endpoints within a dosing regimen will continue in the sequence above until the first time the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, in which case statistical significance cannot be declared for that test or for any of the remaining tests within the dosing regimen.

The time-normalized number of HAE attacks per year is calculated per participant as:

[the number of HAE attacks / length of participant treatment in days] $\times 365.25$

The final IRB/IEC/REC-approved Consent Forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements.

For participants at or above the age of 18 years, signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any trial-related activity. For participants younger than 18 years, signed and dated assent and, if required, a parent/legal guardian’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any trial-related activity. This will be done in accordance with the national and local regulatory requirements. The Investigator or authorized member of the investigational staff will provide the participant full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risks or hazards, alternative treatment options, and potential benefits of the trial. Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent to participate at any time for any reason.

The participant should be provided sufficient time to read the ICF/assent form and consider the information provided and be provided the opportunity to ask questions. The informed consent/assent obtained from the participant and parent/guardian consent, if required, includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data where:

- The participant (and, if applicable, their parent/legal guardian) must be informed that their personal trial-related data will be used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant, who will be required to give consent/assent for their data to be used as described in the informed consent/assent.

- The participant (and, if applicable, their parent/legal guardian) must be informed that their medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC/REC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.

After their review and before entry into the trial, consent and assent are appropriately recorded by means of the participant’s personally dated signature and, if applicable, that of their parent/legal guardian. If a participant is unable to read or write, an impartial witness must be present for the entire informed consent/assent process, which includes reading and explaining all written information, and should personally sign and date the ICF or assent form after oral consent is obtained from the participant, if permitted by local law. The case history or clinical records for each participant shall document the informed consent/assent process and that informed consent/assent was obtained before participation in the trial.

The Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed ICF and assent form. A copy of the signed form must be given to the participant (and, if applicable, their parent/legal guardian).

The ICF and assent form should be revised whenever there are changes to trial procedures or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the participant to participate. If the ICF or assent is revised (through an amendment or an addendum) while a

All signed and dated ICFs and assent forms must remain in each participant’s trial file or in the site file and must be available for verification by trial monitors at any time.

## 12.5. Protection of Participant Data

The Sponsor, in charge of the collection and the processing of the pseudonymized participant data for the purposes of the trial, will ensure that all processing activities involving personal data performed in the scope of this trial are compliant with all applicable legislation of data protection.

With exception of the activities in the scope of the on-site monitoring, inspections, or audit activities, the name of the participant will neither be asked for nor recorded by the Sponsor. An identification number will be allocated to each participant registered in the trial. This number will identify the participant and will be included in all CRFs and corresponding material and data associated with the participant.

The Sponsor has appropriate policies and procedures in place to handle data security breaches in order to mitigate the possible adverse effects.

The participant or legal guardian may exercise their privacy rights including, as applicable, the withdrawal of consent to process the participant’s personal data, in compliance with relevant local law. These details are provided in the ICF.

## 12.6. Biological Specimens and Storage

Biological samples collected during the trial, and data resulting from sample testing, are protected by the use of the unique participant identification number. Samples collected during the trial may also be used to reevaluate biological responses as assays are developed over time. If a participant discontinues the trial, all samples collected prior to trial discontinuation may still be provided to and used by the Sponsor to maintain trial integrity and fulfill trial objectives. If trial participation consent is withdrawn, where applicable, the Sponsor is not required to destroy information or data already collected and can still use such data for the purposes of the trial.

Sample analysis to support exploratory objectives may begin at any time during the sample storage period and may be reported in the CSR or in a separate analysis summary.

Samples will be retained in a secure facility for a minimum of 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of the trial, or for a longer period if required by other applicable regulatory requirements.

## 12.6.1. Genetics

Genetic (DNA) variation may impact a participant’s response to trial intervention, susceptibility to disease, or severity and progression of disease. Variable response to trial intervention may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. The specifics of DNA evaluation are found in Section 7.14.4.3.

If a participant consents to the optional collection of blood for pharmacogenetic/-omic analysis, the Sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. No participant personal identifying information is available to the Sponsor or organizations working with DNA. Accordingly, and as the analysis is exploratory, specific results will not be made available. Aggregate results of genetic analyses may be reported in the CSR or in a separate scientific report.

## 12.6.2. Future Research

Once trial-specified objectives are completed, remaining samples and remaining volume of samples in storage may be used for future research if the participant provides additional consent for this testing.

It is not always possible to define or predict at trial start what new research, information, or technology becomes available that could enable a deeper understanding of factors related to the disease, disease pathway, or study therapeutic. For example, samples stored for future research may prove beneficial to understanding the disease mechanism of action or pathogenesis, risk factors, or how a participant responds to the study therapeutic. This research may be undertaken by the Sponsor, others such as researchers at universities, or clinicians.

Samples stored for future research retain the same participant ID used in the main trial. Participants or legal guardians may withdraw consent for future use at any time during or after the trial by contacting the trial site Investigator. If future use consent is withdrawn, the Sponsor will destroy the sample once all trial-related objectives have been completed; however, if the sample has already been used in future research, the results are not required to be destroyed.

## 12.7. Dissemination of Clinical Trial Data

All information is privileged and confidential, including but not limited to information regarding navenibart or the Sponsor's operations (e.g. patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior clinical data, or formulation information); information supplied by the Sponsor (or designee) to the Investigator and not previously published; and any data generated as a result of the trial. The Investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence, use this information only to conduct the trial, and not use it for any other purpose without prior explicit written consent from the Sponsor.

It is understood that there is an obligation on the part of the Investigator to provide the Sponsor with the complete data obtained during the trial. Such information will be used in the clinical development of navenibart and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required.

Policies concerning publication of data are described in Section 13.

## 12.8. Protocol Adherence

In compliance with ICH E6, Guidelines for GCP, the Investigator should not implement any deviation from or changes to the protocol without written agreement by the Sponsor and documented approval from the IRB/IEC/REC, except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to trial participants.

Investigators will use all diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under no circumstances should the Investigator contact any representative of the Sponsor to request approval of a protocol deviation; no authorized deviations are permitted. If the Investigator believes that a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the trial, the change must be included in a protocol amendment. Protocol amendments must be agreed to by the Sponsor and approved by the Sponsor, health authorities (where required), and the IRB/IEC/REC.

The protocol must be thoroughly read and the instructions must be followed; however, exceptions will be made in emergency situations when the protection, safety, and well-being of the participant requires immediate intervention based on the judgment of the Investigator or a responsible, appropriately trained, and credentialed professional(s) designated by the Investigator as a sub-investigator.

In the event of an important protocol deviation due to an emergency, accident, or error, the Investigator (or designee) must contact the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible time. This will allow for an early joint decision to be made as to whether the participant should continue in the trial. The Investigator, the Sponsor (or designee), and the Medical Monitor will document the decision.

All protocol deviations will be documented in a database. All important protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR.

## 12.8.1. Protocol Deviations

Protocol deviations may be categorized as follows:

1. Violation of the exclusion/inclusion criteria
2. Taking prohibited medications or treatments
3. Treatment misallocation
4. Violation of discontinuation criteria
5. Error in procedures and tests
6. Missed visits

Other deviation categories may be identified as appropriate.

## 12.9. Trial Termination and Clinical Trial Center Closure

Clinical trial centers will be closed upon trial completion. A trial center is considered closed when all required documents and trial supplies have been collected and a trial center closure visit has been performed.

The Sponsor reserves the right to close the clinical trial center at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.

The Investigator may initiate trial center closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and enough notice is provided to the Sponsor in advance of the intended termination.

Astria Therapeutics, Inc.

STAR-0215-301 v00

Reasons for the early closure of a clinical trial center by the Sponsor or Investigator may include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Discovery of an unexpected serious or unacceptable risk to participants enrolled in the trial
- Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC/REC or local health authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
- Inadequate recruitment of participants by the Investigator
- Discontinuation of further navenibart development

If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the IRB/IEC/REC, the regulatory authorities, and any CROs used in the trial of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should ensure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up.

## 13. PUBLICATION POLICY

All information regarding navenibart supplied by the Sponsor to the Investigator or generated by the Investigator in accordance with the conduct of the trial is privileged and confidential information of the Sponsor. The Investigator agrees to use this information to complete the trial and will not use it for other purposes without written consent from the Sponsor. It is understood that the Investigator is obligated to provide the Sponsor with complete data obtained during the trial. The information obtained from the clinical trial will be used by the Sponsor in connection with the development of navenibart and may be disclosed by the Sponsor to regulatory authorities, other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants as required.

The Investigator's rights and obligations with respect to publishing or otherwise presenting information regarding the trial are detailed in the Publication provisions of the Clinical Study Agreement among the Investigator, the clinical site, and the Sponsor. The Investigator shall comply with such provisions.

Publication by any trial site of any data from this trial must be carried out in accordance with the Clinical Trial Agreement and not without prior consent of Astria.
